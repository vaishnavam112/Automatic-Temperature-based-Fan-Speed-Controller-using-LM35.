# Automatic-Temperature-based-Fan-Speed-controller-using-LM35.
 This mini hardware project is designed such that fan speed is controlled by the aurdino uno as per my desire. If the room temperature is less than 30 degree Celcius then fan will be turned off. As temperature increases more than 30 degree Celcius, fan speed will increase by 10% of its initial value.
